# Welcome

I'm a non-traditional student entering tech from a career in sales and retail management, bringing strong communication  
and leadership skills into my transition toward software development.

My journey into tech has been driven by curiosity and self-motivation‚Äîwhether I‚Äôm learning how to build  
iOS apps with Swift, exploring weather APIs for a notification-based app, or digging into the nuts and bolts  
of computer vision for an accessibility tool I call [ColorMatch](https://github.com/elanghorne/ColorMatch).

I‚Äôm particularly interested in projects that bridge utility and creativity: apps that help people live better,  
tools that enhance accessibility, and experiments that deepen my understanding of the full development stack.  
Outside of programming, I enjoy cooking, reading, various sports, and diving into systems-level topics like operating systems and circuits.

This site is a portfolio of my work.
